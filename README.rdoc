A wrapper for the pdf417lib C Library, from the README:

    A library to generate the 2D barcode PDF417

    Project: http://pdf417lib.sourceforge.net/
    Creator: Paulo Soares (psoares@consiste.pt)
    License: LGPL or MPL 1.1

    This library generates a PDF417 image of the barcode in a 1x1 scale.
    It requires that the displayed image be as least stretched 3 times
    in the vertical direction in relation with the horizontal dimension.
    
Fetching the codewords only can be handy for using rtex and the pst-barcode package.  If you're using prawn
or RMagic the to_blob function should help generate a complete barcode.

Much of this was based off of reading through the Nokogiri and RMagic source code.  Thanks!

== Usage

There are a few ways to use the library, at its simplest:

  PDF417.encode_text("readable barcode data") => [12, 827, 120, 90, 41, 146, 30, 512, 423, 146, 90, 570]
  
If you want to get the raw barcode data from the PDF417 library:

 barcode = PDF417.new("readable barcode data")
 barcode.to_blob  # oops, wrong text
 barcode.text = "ACTUAL barcode data"
 barcode.to_blob
 
If you want to get it as an array of strings (each array element representing a line)
  barcode.encoding
  
If you have chunky_png installed and you'd rather have a PNG
  barcode.to_png
 
See the RDocs for more information.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
